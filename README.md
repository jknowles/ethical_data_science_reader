## An Incomplete Reading List

The readings are listed below.

You can find [an annotated version here](Ethical and Inclusive Data Science Readings.pdf).

Additions are welcome! To suggest an addition please file an Issue.

This reading list gives an overview of the ethical concerns specific to data
analysis, data science, and artificial intelligence. Ethics is used broadly here
to mean concerns related to racial and economic equity, justice, fairness, and
the protection of democratic and human rights.

This list is intended to spark
new ideas and prompt critical thinking about data system design and integration
into business processes in an organization. This is not an endorsement of all
viewpoints represented in the readings below – except to say that each of the
readings raise questions, put forward ideas, and make critiques that are worthy
of your deep consideration.  All links last accessed July 11th, 2019.
